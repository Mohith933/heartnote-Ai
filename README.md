# ❤️ HeartNote AI

**HeartNote AI** is an emotion-aware journaling and companion system built to understand human feelings through text and tone.  
It helps users express emotions, track emotional health, and receive gentle AI reflections — like a digital heart listening to you.

## 🌟 Vision
I built HeartNote AI to explore how technology can *feel*, not just compute.  
While many apps track productivity, this one listens to emotions — aiming to help people reconnect with themselves.

## 💡 Inspiration
HeartNote AI was born from the question: *“Can an app understand how you feel, not just what you type?”*  
It’s part of my **Solulure Labs** project series exploring emotional intelligence in AI.
